===================

## Introduction

**Elastos DID (Decentralized Identifier) Swift framework** is a set of Swift APIs for Elastos DID used by dApps on iOS/MacOS platforms, where Elastos DID is the DID system of Elastos ecosystem with compatibility to W3C DIDs specs. 

> Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier for verifiable, decentralized digital identity. These new identifiers are designed to enable the controller of a DID to prove control over it and to be implemented independently of any centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate authority. DIDs are URLs that relate a DID subject to means for trustable interactions with that subject. DIDs resolve to DID Documents â€” simple documents that describe how to use that specific DID. Each DID Document may express cryptographic material, verification methods, and/or service endpoints. These provide a set of mechanisms which enable a DID controller to prove control of the DID. Service endpoints enable trusted interactions with the DID subject.
